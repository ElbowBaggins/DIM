## 6.27.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-30)</span>

* The new armor 2.0 mod workflow is available in the Loadout Optimizer, this includes:
  * A new Mod Picker component to let you choose armor 2.0 mods to lock.
  * The mod sockets shown in the optimiser are now the locked mods, rather than the mods currently equipped on the item.
  * Clicking on a mod socket will open the picker to show available mods for that slot. Note that locking a mod from this won't guarantee it gets locked to the item specifically.
  * Items have different levels of grouping depending on the requirements of the locked mods. Locking no mods keeps the previous grouping behaviour.
  * The mods stat contributions are now shown in the picker.
  * The Mod Picker can now filter for items from a specific season, just filter by the season number directly e.g. "11" for arrivals.
* The search bar now remembers your past searches and allows you to save your favorite searches. These saved and recent searches are synced between devices using DIM Sync.
* The quick item picker (plus icon) menu no longer has an option to equip the selected item. Instead it will always just move the item - very few users selected "Equip" and it won't ever work in game activities.
* Added background colors for items and characters before their images load in, which should reduce the "pop-in" effect.
* Shaders can be tagged from the Collections page and the tags/notes show up there as well.
* Shift+Click on the Notes field in Organizer while in edit mode no longer applies a search.
* For pages with sidebars (like Progress), scrollbars appearing will no longer cover content.
* Add character stats to loadout sheet if full armor set is added.

### Beta Only

* Long-pressing on an item in mobile mode will bring up a quick actions menu - drag and release on a button to apply the action to the item you pressed on.
* Move Sub-class out of Weapons to the General category

## 6.26.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-23)</span>

* Better touchscreen support for drag and drop.
* Wishlists now support Github gists (raw text URLs), so there's no need to set up an entire repository to host them. If you are making wishlists, you can try out changes easier than ever. If you're not making wishlists, hopefully you're using them. If you don't know what wishlists are, [here you go](https://destinyitemmanager.fandom.com/wiki/Wish_Lists)
* Engrams get a more form-fitting outline on mouse hover.
* If you have a search query active, DIM will not automatically reload to update itself.
* The `is:curated` search has been overhauled to better find curated rolls.
* Fixes to how the character headers look in different browsers.
* Fixed the missing armor.csv button on the Organizer.

### Beta Only
* Loadout Optimizer: DIM Beta is now using the new Mod Picker, a separate and improved picker just for armor mods. Try it out and let us know how it feels
* In Beta only, the filter search bar has been upgraded to remember recent searches and let you save your favorite searches.
* Phone/mobile resolutions will now show a mini-popup to make inspecting and moving items much easier.

* Anti-champion damage types are now interpreted in tooltip descriptions.
* Seasonal Artifact is now previewable, but be warned:
  * Some data from the API is wrong, and the Season 11 artifact is incorrectly labeled.
  * It can show seasonal mods you have equipped, but Season 11 mods still aren't in Collections data, so mod unlocks aren't displayed.

* You can add tags and notes to shaders! Keep track of your favorites and which shaders you could do without.
* Searches now support parentheses for grouping, the "and" keyword, and the "not" keyword. Example: `(is:weapon and is:sniperrifle) or not (is:armor and modslot:arrival)`. "and" has higher precedence than "or", which has higher precedence than just a space (which still means "and").
* Fixed the size of damage type icons in D1.
* Our Content Security Policy is more restrictive now, external and injected scripts may fail but this keeps your account and data safer.
